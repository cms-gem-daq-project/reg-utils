reg_utils package
=====================================

Introduction
------------
``reg_utils`` package provides a lightweight and easy to use toolkit to work with XML register address tables. 
It consists of two subpackages: ``reg_interface`` and ``reg_generator``. 

* ``reg_interface`` allows to read the address tables and perform atomic operations with registers and can be extended with more complex methods. 
* ``reg_generator`` allows to generate firmware registers based on the XML address table.
